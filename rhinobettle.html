                  <h3>RHINO BETTLE</h3>
                  <p>The European rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes nasicornis) is a large flying beetle belonging to the subfamily Dynastinae.</p>   
                    
                  <p>One of the largest beetles found in Europe, Oryctes nasicornis reach a length of 20–42 millimetres (3⁄4–1+3⁄4 inches), with a maximum of 47 mm (1+7⁄8 in).[1] The elytra are reddish brown with a glazed appearance, while the head and pronotum are slightly darker. The underside of the body and the legs are covered with long red hair. It is a sexually dimorphic species. The male's head is topped by a long curved horn (hence its common name), while the females have no horns.</p>
